# Preload Warning Fix

## Issue
The browser was showing warnings about preloaded resources not being used within a few seconds of the window's load event:

```
The resource http://localhost:4173/portfolio/images/tarcisio_bispo.webp was preloaded using link preload but not used within a few seconds from the window's load event. Please make sure it has an appropriate `as` value and it is preloaded intentionally.

The resource http://localhost:4173/portfolio/favicon.ico was preloaded using link preload but not used within a few seconds from the window's load event. Please make sure it has an appropriate `as` value and it is preloaded intentionally.

The resource http://localhost:4173/portfolio/images/tarcisio_bispo.png was preloaded using link preload but not used within a few seconds from the window's load event. Please make sure it has an appropriate `as` value and it is preloaded intentionally.
```

## Root Cause
1. The preload tags in `index.html` were using absolute paths without the correct base URL (`/portfolio/`).
2. Some resources were being preloaded but not used immediately on page load.
3. The favicon.ico preload was missing the correct `type` attribute.

## Solution
1. Removed the static preload tags from `index.html` since they were causing warnings.
2. Updated the dynamic preload functions in `cacheOptimization.ts` and `imageOptimization.ts` to:
   - Use `prefetch` instead of `preload` for resources that aren't needed immediately
   - Include the correct `type` attributes for all resources
   - Use the correct base URL from `import.meta.env.BASE_URL`
3. Fixed the `fetchPriority` attribute in `CLSOptimizedImage.tsx` to use lowercase `fetchpriority` for better compatibility.

## Benefits
1. No more browser console warnings about unused preloaded resources
2. Better resource loading strategy with `prefetch` for non-critical resources
3. Maintained the same performance characteristics with proper resource hints
4. Service worker functionality remains intact

## Testing
The changes have been tested to ensure:
1. No browser console warnings appear
2. The profile image and other assets still load correctly
3. Service worker installation and activation work as before
4. The application builds and runs without errors
